    <h2>House Blend Coffee</h2>

    <p style="width:50%">House Blend coffee is unique to every coffee shop, every roaster, and every drinker. That is what makes them so unique and so special. The blending and serving process is built entirely on the preference of the roaster and/or distributor. For example, Starbucks describes their House Blend as “the very first blend we ever created for you back in 1971. The one blend that set the course for the way our master blenders and roasters work even today. A true reflection of us and delicious cup of coffee, period.”</p>
    <p style="width:50%">For House Blend coffee, it has been said to taste best when it has been brewed through a Chemex machine. This machine will bring out the smooth texture and purer flavor of the blend. A Chemex is a “slow-and-steady” approach to coffee brewing, similar to a drip machine, but with a filter that is 3 times as thick. The machine keeps the water that is pouring over the beans at an ideal 190 degrees, draws out any excess oil residue on the bean, and provides the smoothest and purest taste of these unique blends.</p>

    <p style="width:50%">The term French Roast describes the color of the bean after it has been roasted and is traditionally the darkest on the scale of roasts. French roasted coffee tends to have a dark chocolate color, with a smokey, rich flavor. It is believed to have been coined in the 19th century to describe the type of coffee that was being roasted in Europe.Like light roast, dark roast, and medium roast coffee, French roast is also used to describe the color of coffee beans after they have been roasted, as opposed to the region from which it was sourced. </p>

    <!--Colombian Roast Coffee-->
    <h1>Colombian Roast Coffee</h1>
    <img src="./images/colombianroast.jpeg" alt="Columbian Coffee">
    <p style="width:50%">When browsing a coffee shop menu or buying a bag of coffee beans off the shelf, it’s important to know what makes each type of coffee special. You might be interested in trying something different, such as Colombian coffee, but hesitate out of uncertainty. It’s time to change that!
        Colombia is famous for growing some of the best coffee beans in the world; the plants thrive under the shade of banana trees in the tropical climate. Because of Colombia’s high altitude, it also shapes the way the bean grows.
        While the country produces a crazy amount of coffee, it actually exports a lot of its best beans. While going to Colombia for your next brew is an awesome idea, you can also get your hands on the beans and brew them at home! </P>
